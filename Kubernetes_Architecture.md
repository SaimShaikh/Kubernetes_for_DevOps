# üß† Kubernetes Architecture Explained in Depth

This repository provides a **complete breakdown of Kubernetes architecture**, including the **Control Plane**, **Worker Node**, and **Networking components**, along with **roles and responsibilities** for each element.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Control Plane Components

The **Control Plane** is the brain of Kubernetes. It makes global decisions about the cluster (like scheduling) and detects/responds to cluster events (like scaling).

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ API Server

**Role:** The front-end of the Kubernetes Control Plane.
**Responsibilities:**

* Acts as the **central communication hub** for all Kubernetes components.
* Validates and processes **REST requests** (kubectl, client SDKs, or components).
* Exposes the Kubernetes API.
* Stores the cluster state in `etcd`.

üìç **Key Command:**

```bash
kubectl get --raw /api
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ etcd

**Role:** The distributed **key-value store** for all cluster data.
**Responsibilities:**

* Stores cluster configuration and state persistently.
* Provides **consensus** across all nodes using the **Raft protocol**.
* Acts as the **single source of truth** for Kubernetes objects.

üìç **Stored Data Examples:**

* Pods, Deployments, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Node info.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Scheduler

**Role:** Assigns newly created Pods to available Worker Nodes.
**Responsibilities:**

* Watches for **unscheduled Pods**.
* Selects the best node based on **resource availability**, **affinity rules**, and **taints/tolerations**.
* Optimizes load across the cluster.

üìç **Example Criteria:**

* CPU & memory usage
* Node labels
* Pod affinity/anti-affinity
* NodeSelector constraints

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Controller Manager

**Role:** Ensures the desired cluster state is always maintained.
**Responsibilities:**

* Runs background **controllers** (loops) that regulate the system.
* Common controllers:

  * Node Controller ‚Äì monitors node health.
  * ReplicaSet Controller ‚Äì maintains Pod replicas.
  * Endpoint Controller ‚Äì maintains Service endpoints.
  * Job Controller ‚Äì manages batch jobs.

üìç **Concept:**
If something goes wrong, controllers act automatically to bring the system back to the desired state.

üìç **Node Controller Configuration Parameters:**

* **Node Monitor Period:** 5 seconds (default) ‚Äî the frequency at which the node controller checks node status.
* **Node Monitor Grace Period:** 40 seconds (default) ‚Äî the grace period after which a node is considered unhealthy if no status is received.
* **Pod Eviction Timeout:** 5 minutes (default) ‚Äî the time after which Pods on an unreachable node are deleted and recreated on a healthy node.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Kubectl

**Role:** The command-line tool for interacting with the Kubernetes API.
**Responsibilities:**

* Acts as the **primary interface** for users and DevOps engineers to manage Kubernetes clusters.
* Sends commands to the **API Server**, which then performs the requested operations.
* Supports CRUD operations for all Kubernetes objects (Pods, Deployments, Services, etc.).
* Provides debugging, scaling, and monitoring capabilities.

üìç **Common Commands:**

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml
```

üìç **Usage Example:**

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl get deployments -n kube-system
```

---

## üß© Worker Node Components

Each **Worker Node** runs actual workloads (containers) and communicates with the Control Plane.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Kubelet

**Role:** The primary node agent.
**Responsibilities:**

* Registers the node with the cluster.
* Ensures that Pods are running as defined in PodSpecs.
* Reports node and Pod status to the API Server.
* Restarts failed Pods via the container runtime.

üìç **Command Example:**

```bash
systemctl status kubelet
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Kube-Proxy (Service Proxy)

**Role:** Manages network rules to allow communication inside/outside the cluster.
**Responsibilities:**

* Maintains **network routing** and **load balancing** for Services.
* Handles cluster-wide IP routing (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer).
* Works at both **L4 (TCP/UDP)** and **L7 (HTTP)** levels.

üìç **Modes:**

* `iptables` mode
* `ipvs` mode

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Container Runtime

**Role:** Runs containers inside Pods.
**Responsibilities:**

* Pulls container images.
* Starts and stops containers.
* Reports container status to Kubelet.
* Common runtimes: **containerd**, **CRI-O** (Docker used to be, now deprecated).

üìç **Command Example:**

```bash
crictl ps
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Pod

**Role:** The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
**Responsibilities:**

* Encapsulates one or more containers.
* Shares the same network namespace (localhost) and storage volumes.
* Represents a single instance of an application.

üìç **Command Example:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

---

## üåê Networking Component

### CNI (Container Network Interface)

**Role:** Connects containers and nodes within the cluster.
**Responsibilities:**

* Assigns IPs to Pods.
* Enables inter-Pod communication.
* Manages network policies.
* Integrates with plugins like Calico, Flannel, or WeaveNet.

üìç **Command Example:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep cni
```
